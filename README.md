# MyPortfolio

My name is Christian and I am an aspiring Web Developer.


This portfolio is a project I desire to kick start my pursuit being a web developer. This website currently consists of a navigation bar, hero header, about me and a contact section. My focus was to create a static website displaying what I have learnt thus far in this course and my ability to also use resources on the internet such as youtube and google and how I can modify and enhance my website.

This website will be used as a foundational template into what I continue to learn in this course and further develop the design and functionality of what I have currently made to display the improvement over this course. I hope to be able to flesh out this portfolio into an application worthy portfolio!
